When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - When you want to collaborate.
    - When I want other people to see my work
    - To back-up my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    More control and also because you don't want to pull changes that cause confusion.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches - Modify existing repo itself.
    Clones - From github or even existing repo to anywhere.
    Fork - From github to github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you have no internet access just fetch the last known state. After the work is done you can 
    merge it later also without needing access to the internet. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'd have to upload zip files. Which would be a lot harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Gotta use the separate branch method if you want other people to review your changes first.
